# C. 8-puzzle best-fs solution

solve a 8-puzzle game using best first search algorithm, and print the initial puzzle and the steps to solution into a solution.txt file, and also print the over all cost of the solution, then show all the steps visually on the puzzle board.

## Requirements:

- Nice and modern GUI is required
- Each move will cost you 1
- Print the initial board and all the steps and the over all cost to a file names solution.txt
- Feel free to use any library or code to save the solution.txt file ( nicer is better )
- All computation must be done in background and only the solution should be shown on the GUI
- the board is random on each program run
